"""
SignalFusionEngine — combines Kronos MC forecast, regime model, and DeepSeek
context into a single gated TradingSignal.

Gate 1 (DeepSeek): suppress_trading=True  → return None
Gate 2 (direction): Kronos ≠ regime       → log warning, and return None ONLY when
    config.REGIME_GATE2_ENFORCING=True. Skipped entirely if regime not trained.

Combined probability formula (when both models available):
    combined = 0.6 * kronos_calibrated + 0.4 * regime_prob
    if deepseek_regime == "high_uncertainty":
        combined = 0.5 + (combined - 0.5) * 0.5   # 50% shrink
    elif deepseek_regime == "ranging":
        combined = 0.5 + (combined - 0.5) * 0.7   # 30% shrink — noisy but tradeable

When RegimeModel raises NotTrainedError (regime model not yet trained):
    combined = 0.5 + (kronos_calibrated - 0.5) * _BOOTSTRAP_SHRINK  (0.8, not 0.5)
    Gate 2 is bypassed — trading is allowed with conservative Kronos-only signal.

Note: _BOOTSTRAP_SHRINK (0.8) is intentionally lighter than _UNCERTAINTY_SHRINK (0.5).
During bootstrap the regime model is simply untrained — that is different from
DeepSeek signalling genuine high uncertainty. A 50% shrink was preventing Gate 5
from passing during bootstrap, stalling trade accumulation indefinitely.
