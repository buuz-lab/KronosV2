# KronosV2 — Agent Handoff

## Goal

Bootstrap a live BTC prediction-market trading system on Kalshi (KXBTC15M 15-min
up/down markets). Forecast direction via Kronos + XGBoost regime classifier +
DeepSeek gate, size with fractional Kelly, run 6 pre-trade gates. **Current
focus:** accumulate 500 training-ready rows, then train and deploy the RegimeModel.
The pipeline is fully instrumented — just waiting on data volume.

---

## Current Progress

**As of 2026-05-22 ~21:00 UTC: ~23+ training-ready rows. System requires a restart
to pick up all changes from today's sessions.**

- `PAPER_TRADING=true` in `.env`
- **~32 trades/day resolved rate. Expected to hit 500 training-ready rows ~2026-06-07.**
- Previous stats at session start: 226 total trades / 17 training-ready rows, 142W / 83L (63%), Net P&L: +$307.01.
- **System needs a restart** to activate loguru hardening, overlapping refresh, watchdog, and LKG fallback.
- **OKX outage 14:20–21:00+ PDT today.** Watchdog fired ERROR continuously. Trades during
  this window fired on stale (zero) features. LKG fix addresses this for future outages.

**Go-live thresholds (both must be met):**
- ≥ 500 resolved trades total — for calibrator
- ≥ 500 training-ready rows (`features_stale=0 AND funding_rate IS NOT NULL AND
  outcome IS NOT NULL`) — for regime model training

---

## What Worked (most recent first)

- **Last-Known-Good (LKG) feature fallback.** During exchange outages `regime:features`
  expires and was returning all-zero features to Gate 2. Fix: `_write_features()` now
  also writes `regime:features:lkg` (TTL=24h) with a `_lkg_written_at` timestamp.
  `_get_market_context()` tries LKG when the primary key is expired, logs the age, and
  injects `_lkg=True` sentinel. `fusion._regime_features()` treats `_lkg=True` as stale
  so those rows are excluded from training — same as zero-fallback rows. Gate 2 now runs
  on real (aged) features instead of zeros during multi-hour OKX outages.
  Triggered by: 14:20–21:00+ PDT OKX outage on 2026-05-22.
- **Per-trade feature snapshot via TradingSignal.** Added `regime_features: dict`
  and `features_stale: bool` to the `TradingSignal` dataclass. Persisted values
  are exactly what the model was fed — no train/serve skew possible.
- **Idempotent ALTER TABLE migration.** `_TRADES_COLUMN_MIGRATIONS` in `main.py`
  runs every startup, swallowing duplicate-column errors.
- **`features_stale` flag.** When Redis `regime:features` is missing/expired,
  fusion uses 0.0 fallbacks for inference but tags the row stale. Training filters
  on `features_stale=0`.
- **Label semantics.** `up_label = int(direction == outcome)` — NOT `outcome`.
  The `outcome` column means "did this trade win," which is inverted for short
  trades. All evaluation code in this repo uses this formula consistently.
- **Soft-launch Gate 2.** `REGIME_GATE2_ENFORCING=false` default. Disagreements
  are logged but not blocked. Avoids sudden ~30% drop in trade frequency.
- **3-fold walk-forward CV** in train_regime.py for evaluation confidence.
  Fold windows operate on `X_train` only — held-out `--test-size` rows stay
  completely outside CV. Warns if Brier std > 0.05.
- **`return 0.0` in `_funding_rate_trend` fallback.** When the 4-hour window
  can't be computed, returns neutral (not a noisy delta from history[0]).
- **`_FRESH_FILTER` constant in regime_health_check.py / auto_retrain.py.**
  Requires all 6 feature columns NOT NULL (not just `funding_rate`) to prevent
  NaN passthrough to inference.
- **Loguru hardening (`enqueue=True, catch=True`).** File sink no longer silently
  drops itself on write/rotation errors. `enqueue=True` makes writes non-blocking
  and thread-safe under asyncio.
- **TTL=600s for `regime:features`.** Doubled from 300s — tolerates one full
  missed refresh cycle without expiring.
- **Overlapping refresh in `DerivativesFeed.run()`.** After a successful write,
  sleeps 240s instead of 300s. Key is always renewed with 60s to spare, even if
  OKX fetch takes extra time.
- **`_regime_watchdog` coroutine in `KronosV2`.** Checks `regime:features` TTL
  every 60s. Fires macOS notifications (via `osascript`) and logs WARNING/ERROR
  if TTL drops below 90s or key is fully expired. Wired into `asyncio.gather`.

---

## What Failed / Avoided

- **Backfilling the 200+ pre-instrumentation trades.** Rejected — funding rate /
  OI / CVD / basis history not reliably reconstructable. Pre-migration rows stay
  training-invisible (NULL features), used only for calibrator + edge tracker.
- **Re-reading Redis at `_record_trade_sqlite`.** Would reintroduce train/serve
  skew if a cycle spans a DerivativesFeed refresh. Signal carries the snapshot.
- **Consolidating the two `brti_volatility_1h` implementations.** `DerivativesFeed`
  uses Redis ticks; `fusion._regime_features()` uses 5-min OHLCV pct_change std.
  The persisted column is the fusion version. Do NOT consolidate after training
  begins — it would invalidate any trained model.
- **Using `old = history[0]` as funding_rate_trend fallback.** Made the lookback
  window non-deterministic (silently stretched to 80+ hours). Fixed to `return 0.0`.
- **TTL == refresh interval (both 300s).** Any asyncio scheduling drift or slow
  OKX call caused the key to expire before renewal. Root cause of all staleness
  incidents observed. Fixed via TTL=600s + overlapping refresh.
- **Loguru silent sink death.** At 05:07 UTC all 4 exchange feeds disconnected
  simultaneously + Kalshi API timeout. Log rotation failed during this storm and
  loguru silently dropped the file sink at 05:16 UTC. System traded blind for 7
  hours with no log record. Fixed via `catch=True` + `enqueue=True`.

## Files Touched / Created

### This session (2026-05-22, late evening — Coinglass + Kraken fallbacks)

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `btc_kalshi_system/data/derivatives_feed.py` | Split `_fetch_features()` into `_fetch_funding_and_oi()` (OKX→Coinglass REST fallback) and `_fetch_trades_data()` (OKX→Kraken ccxt fallback). Added `_coinglass_funding_and_oi()` and `_kraken_trades_data()`. Constants `_KRAKEN_SYMBOL`, `_COINGLASS_BASE` added. `_kraken_exchange` lazy attribute in `__init__`. |
| `config.py` | Added `COINGLASS_API_KEY: str = os.getenv("COINGLASS_API_KEY", "")`. |
| `tests/data/test_derivatives_feed.py` | +2 tests: Coinglass fallback called when OKX funding/OI fails; Kraken fallback called when OKX trades fail, with correct CVD value asserted. `make_feed()` updated with `_kraken_exchange`, `_ccxt_async`, `_prev_oi` attributes. |

### This session (2026-05-22, evening — LKG fix)

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `btc_kalshi_system/data/derivatives_feed.py` | Added `_LKG_TTL = 86_400`. `_write_features()` now also writes `regime:features:lkg` (24h TTL) with `_lkg_written_at` timestamp. |
| `main.py` | `_get_market_context()`: when `regime:features` expired, tries `regime:features:lkg`; pops timestamp, logs age, injects `_lkg=True` sentinel, returns LKG dict instead of `{}`. |
| `btc_kalshi_system/signal/fusion.py` | `_regime_features()`: staleness check expanded to `stale = not ctx or ctx.get("_lkg", False)` so LKG rows are still excluded from training. |
| `tests/data/test_derivatives_feed.py` | +1 test: `test_lkg_key_written_on_successful_write` — verifies LKG key exists, TTL~86400, all 6 feature keys present, `_lkg_written_at` populated. |

### This session (2026-05-22, afternoon)

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `main.py` | Loguru file sink: added `enqueue=True, catch=True`. Added `_regime_watchdog` coroutine (TTL check every 60s, macOS notifications via `osascript` on WARNING/ERROR). Wired watchdog into `asyncio.gather`. Added `import subprocess`. |
| `btc_kalshi_system/data/derivatives_feed.py` | `_FEATURES_TTL` 300→600. `run()` overlapping refresh: sleep 240s (not 300s) after successful write so key never expires before renewal. |

### Prior session (commit `4f8ff3f`, 2026-05-22 morning)

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `scripts/train_regime.py` | Feature variance gate, 3-fold walk-forward CV, feature importance logging, `--max-rows N` flag. |
| `scripts/regime_health_check.py` | **NEW.** Diagnostic script for training progress, staleness rate, model health. |
| `scripts/auto_retrain.py` | **NEW.** Cron-driven retraining with emergency/row/time triggers. |
| `btc_kalshi_system/data/derivatives_feed.py` | `_funding_rate_trend` fallback: `return 0.0`. |
| `tests/data/test_derivatives_feed.py` | +1 test for funding_rate_trend zero fallback. |

### Prior session (commit `d3933be`, 2026-05-21)

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `btc_kalshi_system/signal/fusion.py` | `TradingSignal` carries `regime_features` + `features_stale`. Gate 2 soft-launch. |
| `btc_kalshi_system/models/regime_model.py` | `train()` accepts `**xgb_kwargs`. |
| `main.py` | 23-column schema, idempotent ALTER TABLE, regime feature persistence, `RegimeModel.load()` fallback. |
| `config.py` | `REGIME_MODEL_PATH`, `REGIME_GATE2_ENFORCING`. |

## Next Steps

1. **Restart the bot** to pick up this session's changes (loguru hardening,
   overlapping refresh, watchdog). Confirm watchdog is logging TTL checks and
   that no macOS notifications fire immediately after startup.

2. **Monitor training-ready row accumulation.** Run `python3 scripts/regime_health_check.py`
   daily. Expect 500 rows ~2026-06-07 at current rate.

3. **(Optional) Add auto_retrain to crontab.** Copy the crontab line from the top
   of `scripts/auto_retrain.py`. Test first with `python3 scripts/auto_retrain.py --dry-run`.

4. **Train the model when ready.** `python3 scripts/train_regime.py --dry-run`
   previews Brier / accuracy. If sane (Brier < 0.25, Kronos agreement > 55%),
   re-run without `--dry-run` to save `models/regime.pkl`. Restart — it auto-loads.

5. **Flip `REGIME_GATE2_ENFORCING=true` in `.env` and restart** after observing
   ~50 shadow trades with a 20-40% disagreement rate (not 50%+).

## Context / Gotchas

- **Test suite invariant: 207 pass.** Run from project root: `python3 -m pytest`.
- **Bot must be restarted** for this session's changes to take effect.
- **Watchdog uses whatever redis client is available on existing KronosV2 instance
  variables** — do not add a second redis connection. Check `self._store._redis`
  or equivalent.
- **macOS notifications use `osascript`** — WARNING fires with sound "Basso",
  ERROR fires with sound "Sosumi". If notifications stop appearing, check that
  Terminal/Python has notification permissions in macOS System Settings.
- **Kronos preload rule.** Apple Silicon segfault avoidance: preload Kronos in
  `KronosV2.__init__()` before asyncio, `map_location="cpu"`, `set_num_threads(1)`
  BEFORE `from_pretrained`. Do not refactor.
- **Label = `int(direction == outcome)`, NOT `outcome`.** `outcome` means "did
  this trade win," inverted for short trades. All evaluation code uses this formula.
- **Two `brti_volatility_1h` implementations exist.** `DerivativesFeed` (Redis
  ticks) vs `fusion._regime_features()` (5-min OHLCV pct_change). Persisted column
  is the fusion version. Do not consolidate after model training begins.
- **CV fold windows must stay out of the held-out test set.** Folds are computed
  on `n_cv = n_total - args.test_size` rows, not all rows.
- **`_TRAINING_READY_FILTER` in auto_retrain.py uses the looser 3-condition
  filter** (`features_stale=0, funding_rate IS NOT NULL, outcome IS NOT NULL`) —
  not the strict 6-column filter.
- **Gate 2 starts in SHADOW mode after loading a model.** Set
  `REGIME_GATE2_ENFORCING=true` only after observing ~50 trades. Default `false`.
- **`dump.rdb` is in git but must NOT be staged in commits.** Stage code files
  explicitly. Same for `trades.db.bak.*`.
- **`prev_oi` in `DerivativesFeed` is an instance attribute.** One false-zero
  `oi_delta_pct` on cold start is expected and harmless.
- **LKG sentinel `_lkg=True` in market context dict.** When `_get_market_context()`
  falls back to `regime:features:lkg`, it injects `_lkg=True` into the returned dict.
  `fusion._regime_features()` checks `ctx.get("_lkg", False)` to force `stale=True`.
  The `_lkg` and `_lkg_written_at` keys are never included in the 6-feature dict fed to
  XGBoost — the feature dict is built by explicitly listing the 6 keys. Do not add
  `_lkg` to the feature list or it will corrupt model inputs.
- **Calibrator is independent.** Uses only `kronos_raw + outcome`, not regime
  features. Hits its 500-sample threshold separately.
- **DeepSeek `NEUTRAL_DEFAULT` on 402, not `SAFE_DEFAULT`.**
- **`_RANGING_SHRINK = 0.7`, `_BOOTSTRAP_SHRINK = 0.8`, `_UNCERTAINTY_SHRINK =
  0.5`** in `fusion.py`. Bootstrap shrink is intentionally lighter than uncertainty
  shrink. Do not equate.
- **15-min reference price = last completed 15-min BRTI candle close.** Do not
  revert to `composite_price`.
- **Gate 6 is skipped for `timeframe == "15min"`.**
- **RSA-PSS Kalshi signing, sign path-only.**
- **Coinglass fallback requires `COINGLASS_API_KEY` in `.env`** (`CG-API-KEY` header, v4 API). Without it, the Coinglass fallback logs a WARNING and returns zeros — OKX must recover on its own. Endpoint used: `/api/futures/funding-rate/history` (OKX, BTCUSDT, 8h interval) + `/api/futures/open-interest/exchange-list` (BTC). OI is filtered for `exchange=="OKX"` to stay on the same unit scale as the primary path.
- **Kraken fallback uses spot `BTC/USD` trades** (not a perp). CVD and basis_spread_pct still computed correctly — spot price ≈ BRTI so basis ≈ 0. No API key required.
